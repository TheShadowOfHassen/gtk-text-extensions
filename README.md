# gtk-textview-extensions
 Extensions for Gtk textviews. In the MIT license. You can use this code in whatever you want, but if you improve it please pass the improvements on to this

This is very much a work in progress.

Eventually the extentions will be

- A spellcheck wrapper for savvy and other spell checkers.
- A markdown formatter.
